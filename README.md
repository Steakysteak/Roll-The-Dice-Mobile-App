# Roll-The-Dice-Mobile-App

*Added Haptic Feedback*

Firstly, haptic feedback is an essential aspect of modern user interfaces that can provide users with tactile feedback when interacting with digital devices. This feature is particularly useful in mobile applications where users may not always be looking at the screen. With haptic feedback, users can receive tactile feedback that helps them navigate and interact with the app in a more intuitive manner.

To enable haptic feedback in your mobile app, you have added a new branch to your project that integrates the react-native-haptic-feedback package. This package is a popular choice for enabling haptic feedback in React Native applications and provides a simple API for triggering haptic feedback on both iOS and Android devices.

To begin, you have installed the react-native-haptic-feedback package using the npm package manager. This package provides a simple API that allows you to trigger different types of haptic feedback, such as vibration, impact, and selection. You have also added a new component to your app that will serve as the trigger for the haptic feedback.

In the code, you have imported the react-native-haptic-feedback package and used it to define a new function that triggers the haptic feedback. This function takes an optional feedback type parameter and calls the appropriate haptic feedback API based on the specified type.

You have also added an event listener to your app that calls the haptic feedback function whenever the user interacts with the trigger component. This event listener is attached to the appropriate gesture or button press event in your app and ensures that the haptic feedback is triggered whenever the user interacts with the app.

Overall, the haptic feedback feature you have added to your mobile app using the react-native-haptic-feedback package is an important enhancement that will improve the user experience and make your app more intuitive to use. By providing users with tactile feedback, you can help them navigate and interact with your app more easily, even when they are not looking at the screen.
